## 2.3 WIRELESS TRANSMISSION 

### 2.3.1 The Electromagnetic Spectrum

1. **Frequency hopping  spread spectrum** ， the transmitter hops from frequency to frequency hundreds of times per second.
2. **Direct sequence spread spectrum**, uses a  code sequence to spread the data signal over a wider frequency band.
3. A third method of communication with a wider band is UWB (Ultra WideBand) communication

### 2.3.2 Radio Transmission 

Radio frequency (RF) waves are easy to generate, can travel long distances, and can penetrate buildings easily,

### 2.3.3 Microwave Transmission 

**disadvantages**

1. Unlike radio waves at lower frequencies, microwaves do not pass through buildings well.
2. Bands up to 10 GHz are now in routine use, but at about 4 GHz a new problem sets in: absorption by water

**advantages**

1. The main one is that no right of way is needed to lay down  cables.
2. Microwave is also relatively inexpensive 

### 2.3.4 Infrared Transmission

1. they do not pass through solid objects. 
2. On the other hand, the fact that infrared waves do not pass through solid walls  well is also a plus. It means that an infrared system in one room of a building will  not interfere with a similar system in adjacent rooms or buildings: you cannot control your neighbor’s television with your remote control.

### 2.3.5 Light Transmission
