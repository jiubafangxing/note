## 1.4.5 A Critique of the OSI Model and Protocols

OSI参考模型没有被完整实现原因：

1. Bad timing（*apocalypse of the two elephants*）
2. Bad technology
3. Bad implementations
4. Bad politics

###  1.4.6 A Critique of the TCP/IP Reference Model 

1. The model  does not clearly distinguish the concepts of services, interfaces, and protocols. Consequently, the TCP/IP model is not much of a guide for designing new networks using new technologies.

2. The TCP/IP model is not at all general and is poorly suited to describing any protocol stack other than TCP/IP

3. The link layer is not really a layer at all in the normal sense of the term  as used in the context of layered protocols

4. The TCP/IP model does not distinguish between the physical and data link layers.

5. Finally, although the IP and TCP protocols were carefully thought out and 

   well implemented, many of the other protocols were ad hoc, generally produced 

   by a couple of graduate students hacking away until they got tired. The protocol 

   implementations were then distributed free, which resulted in their becoming 

   widely used, deeply entrenched, and thus hard to replace.
