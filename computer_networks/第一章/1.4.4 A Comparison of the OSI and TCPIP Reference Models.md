### 1.4.4 A Comparison of the OSI and TCP/IP Reference Models

Three concepts are central to the OSI model:

1. **Services** . The service definition tells what the layer does, not how entities 

   above it access it or how the layer works.

2. **Interfaces** . It specifies what the parameters are and what results to expect

3. **Protocols**. The peer *protocols* used in a layer are the layerâ€™s own business

The TCP/IP model did not originally clearly distinguish between services, interfaces, and protocols.Turning from philosophical matters to more specific ones, an obvious difference between the two models is the number of layers: the OSI model has seven  layers and the TCP/IP model has four. Both have (inter)network, transport, and  application layers, but the other layers are different.  Another difference is in the area of connectionless versus connection-oriented  communication. The OSI model supports both connectionless and connectionoriented communication in the network layer, but only connection-oriented communication in the transport layer, where it counts (because the transport service is  visible to the users). The TCP/IP model supports only one mode in the network  layer (connectionless) but both in the transport layer, giving the users a choice.  This choice is especially important for simple request-response protocols.
