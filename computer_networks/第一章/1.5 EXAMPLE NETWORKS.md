## 1.5 EXAMPLE NETWORKS 

### 1.5.3 Wireless LANs: 802.11 

1. The first problem was to find a suitable frequency band  that was available, preferably worldwide. Instead of expensive, licensed spectrum,  802.11 systems operate in unlicensed bands such as the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) bands defined by ITU-R (e.g., 902-928 MHz, 2.4-2.5 GHz,  5.725-5.825 GHz)
2. Another problem is that of mobility. 
3. Finally, there is the problem of security.
