## 2.5 DIGITAL MODULATION AND MULTIPLEXIN

###  2.5.1 Baseband Transmission

**Bandwidth Efficiency**

1. We call the rate at which the signal changes the **symbol rate** to distinguish it  from the **bit rate**.
2. An older name for the symbol rate, particularly in the context of devices called telephone modems that convey digital data over telephone lines, is  the **baud rate**.



**Clock Recovery**

For all schemes that encode bits into symbols, the receiver must know when  one symbol ends and the next symbol begins to correctly decode the bits.

A clever trick here is to mix the  clock signal with the data signal by XORing them together so that no extra line is  needed. This scheme is called **Manchester**  encoding and was used for classic Ethernet.
